<p>
The <big>Supreme Court’s</big> landmark ruling Thursday on affirmative action pitted its two Black justices against each other, with the ideologically opposed jurists employing unusually sharp language attacking each other by name.</p>

<p>
The <small>majority opinion</small> authored by Chief Justice John Roberts said colleges and universities can no longer take race into consideration as a specific basis for granting admission. Justice Clarence Thomas and the court’s other four conservatives joined Roberts’ opinion.</p>

<p>
Thomas, who in 1991 became the second Black person to ascend to the nation’s highest court, issued a lengthy concurrence that attacked such admissions programs and tore into arguments posited by liberal <u>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson</u>, the <i>first Black woman</i> to join the court, who penned her own fiery dissent in the case.</p>
